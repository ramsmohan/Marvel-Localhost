A Marvelous theme for your Localhost files and folders to display in a searchable manner and with an awesome theme. Clone in root of localhost and Enjoy..
## Steps to have a cool localhot page rather than the Regular Localhost
  1. Remove the default index.php file from your Root of Xampp / Wamp / Lamp / Mamp installation directory.
  2. Clone the Project in here.
  3. Copy index.php and assets from Repository and paste in Your root.
